### One is both likeable and liking

Most people do not like themselves, primarily due to felt inequity and imparity inherent to one's social identity.

> **VINEETO**: Many social identity aspects can be described as having to do with ‘self-worth’ (and self-worth as derived from other people’s opinion – social status, respect, acceptance, authority, control, pride – in other words, inequity and imparity, the very components which stand in the way to peace-on-earth amongst fellow human beings. [..] [source](https://actualfreedom.com.au/actualism/actualvineeto/basictofullfreedom2.htm)

To be naive means one likes oneself (one is likeable) as a human being (regardless of the social identity) which necessarily also means that one likes one's fellow human being (regardless of 'who' they think/feel themselves to be) bar none. The "bar none" is important (see below), because there's no favouritism (no distinction by status/ class/ age/ gender etc.). It is a reliably sweet way of going about life!

> **RICHARD**: [..] a persona who cannot unreservedly like themselves—even at the deepest core of their very ‘being’—cannot unconditionally like any other persona either (all of whom are, likewise, ‘rotten to the core’ as well)? [source](https://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-naivete.htm)

The immediate goal of an actualist is to consistently stay being naive (being both likeable and liking)—and *thereby* diminish their social identity in the process—such as to facilitate the pure intent necessary for self-immolation to occur.

> **RICHARD:** Look, the whole point of minimising both the malicious/ sorrowful feelings (the ‘bad’ feelings) and their antidotal loving/ compassionate feelings (the ‘good’ feelings) whilst maximising the felicitous/ innocuous feelings (the ‘congenial’ feelings) is to make for a potent combination when this untrammelled conviviality operates in conjunction with a naïve sensuosity – whereby **one is both likeable and liking** – such that the benevolence and benignity of pure intent may increasingly become dynamically enabled for one purpose and one purpose alone ... to wit: for the already always existing peace-on-earth to become apparent, in this lifetime, as this flesh-and-blood body.

### Naiveté is quite unilateral

One's state of naiveté does not have to be impacted by what the other does or does not do.

> **RICHARD**: It is impossible to not like somebody, whatever the mischief is they get up to, as an actual intimacy does not switch on and off and operates unilaterally in regards every man, woman and child without exception ... nobody is special because everybody is special simply by being alive as a flesh and blood body’ [source](https://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-humanity.htm)

### Naive intimacy vs love

In the specific context of intimacy (notably, sexuality and its psychic accompaniments such as love & romance), it is vital to keep in mind that naivete — which now manifests as *naive intimacy* in an intimate setting — stands in stark contrast to _"**the affectional intimacy of romance lore and legend**"_, and requires a _"considerable finesse of focus"_ to remember to be as naive as possible in order to counteract the instinctual tendency to veer towards love, sometimes in the most cunning ways.

> **MARTIN:** _Is it as simple as that?_
>
> **RICHARD:** As your nominative pronoun _“it”_ draws its referencing function from the way in which intimacy experiences (IE’s) come about as per feeling-being ‘Grace’s gradations of scale regarding the range of naïveness from being sincere to becoming naïve and all the way through being naïveté itself to an actual innocence – (this syntactically precise exegesis of the referent whence your query derives relevance is purely for the sake of clarity in communication) – then ... no, _“it”_ is not _“as simple as that”_ (in your case liking women rather than loving them; in ‘her’ case liking men rather than loving them) as some considerable finesse of focus is called for in order to discern this which is as entirely new to human experience/ human history as an actual freedom from the human condition is.

> Perhaps if I were to put it this way:  untold billions of peoples down through the ages and across cultures have liked, rather than loved, another and/or others relationally, familially and societally – and yet even so the near-innocent intimacy of naïveté does not appear in the dictionary listings – to the point that it speaks volumes regarding the all-dominating puissance of blind nature’s rough-and-ready instinctual survival passions which, whilst self-evidently successful in its proliferative perpetuation of the species, nevertheless blindly dictate that no other course of action, vis-à-vis being intimate, than love’s affectuous intimacy will ever instinctually come about.

### Appreciation

Note: the author is currently actively exploring this connection. In the meanwhile, [this](https://an.actualfreedom.com.au/various/well-equippedmarvelling.htm) is a good place to start.

> **VINEETO**: Becoming naïve is indeed _“tightly connected”_ to be able to _“appreciate this moment of being alive whatever form it takes.”_ [source](https://www.actualfreedom.com.au/actualism/actualvineeto/almog.htm)
