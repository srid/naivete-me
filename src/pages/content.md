**Naiveté** is that intimate aspect of oneself that one usually keeps hidden away for fear of seeming foolish ... it is like being a child again, but with adult sensibilities, which means that one can separate out the distinction between being naïve and being gullible."

Some synonyms of **naiveté** are: _guileless, artless, simple, ingenuous, innocuous, unsophisticated, artless, frank, open_."

## Various aspects

### Naively open and sincere

The usual modus operandi when investigating feelings is to be closed (and cunning), by predicting a particular way of doing it and framing oneself in that closed fashion. Since this is the only moment there is — and the future cannot be predestined — one might as well remain open (be naively open) to whatever pops up. Stay fascinatedly curious as to how this moment will unfold: whenever one is no longer feeling good, one can look at **whatever** that is, without needing to maintain a premonition about it.

The openness of naiveté acts to counteract the self-centered outlook of the identity.

### One is both **likeable and liking**

Most people do not like themselves due to felt inequity and imparity of their social identity. To be naive means one likes oneself (one is likeable) as a human being (regardless of the social identity) which necessarily also means that one likes one's fellow human being (regardless of 'who' they think/feel themselves to be) bar none. The "bar none" is important, because there's no favouritism (no distinction by status/class/etc.). It is a sweet way of going about life!

The goal of an actualist is to consistently stay being naive (being both likeable and liking), and thereby diminish their social identity in the process.

> **RICHARD:** Look, the whole point of minimising both the malicious/ sorrowful feelings (the ‘bad’ feelings) and their antidotal loving/ compassionate feelings (the ‘good’ feelings) whilst maximising the felicitous/ innocuous feelings (the ‘congenial’ feelings) is to make for a potent combination when this untrammelled conviviality operates in conjunction with a naïve sensuosity – whereby **one is both likeable and liking** – such that the benevolence and benignity of pure intent may increasingly become dynamically enabled for one purpose and one purpose alone ... to wit: for the already always existing peace-on-earth to become apparent, in this lifetime, as this flesh-and-blood body.

### **Naive intimacy** vs _the affectional intimacy of romance lore and legend_

In the specific context of intimacy (i.e., sexuality and its psychic accompaniments such as love & romance), it is vital to keep in mind that naivete — which now manifests as *naive intimacy* — stands in stark contrast to the affectional intimacy of romance lore and legend, and requires a _"considerable finesse of focus"_ to remember to be as naive as possible in order to counteract the instinctual tendency towards love.

> **MARTIN:** _Is it as simple as that?_

> **RICHARD:** As your nominative pronoun _“it”_ draws its referencing function from the way in which intimacy experiences (IE’s) come about as per feeling-being ‘Grace’s gradations of scale regarding the range of naïveness from being sincere to becoming naïve and all the way through being naïveté itself to an actual innocence – (this syntactically precise exegesis of the referent whence your query derives relevance is purely for the sake of clarity in communication) – then ... no, _“it”_ is not _“as simple as that”_ (in your case liking women rather than loving them; in ‘her’ case liking men rather than loving them) as some considerable finesse of focus is called for in order to discern this which is as entirely new to human experience/ human history as an actual freedom from the human condition is.

> Perhaps if I were to put it this way:  untold billions of peoples down through the ages and across cultures have liked, rather than loved, another and/or others relationally, familially and societally – and yet even so the near-innocent intimacy of naïveté does not appear in the dictionary listings – to the point that it speaks volumes regarding the all-dominating puissance of blind nature’s rough-and-ready instinctual survival passions which, whilst self-evidently successful in its proliferative perpetuation of the species, nevertheless blindly dictate that no other course of action, vis-à-vis being intimate, than love’s affectuous intimacy will ever instinctually come about.
