Naiveté explained.

## What is this?

I am exploring an interactive website to best explain the actualist [naiveté](https://srid.ca/naivet%C3%A9) to anyone in general and actualists in particular. The site is being built as a [Leptos CSR](https://book.leptos.dev/view/index.html) app deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Development

Run `just run` in the Nix devShell.
