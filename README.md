Naiveté explained.

## What is this?

I am exploring an interactive website to best explain actualist [naiveté](https://srid.ca/naivet%C3%A9) to anyone in general and actualists in particular. The site is being built as a [Leptos CSR](https://book.leptos.dev/view/index.html) app deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Development

Run `just run` in the Nix devShell.

## Content

Various aspects of naiveté to explain:

- being likeable and liking
- being naive open -> having fun finding out how one ticks
- naive intimacy vs _the affectional intimacy of romance lore and legend_
- tangential concepts
  - appreciation
  - harmlessness

## Some ideas

### Dictionary popups

Hover or click on words to have their definitions popup ([example](https://github.com/dominiclet/obsidian-note-definitions#obsidian-note-definitions)).

This popup mechanism can be extended for footnotes as well.

### Quizes?

Multi-choice and such questions with a button that reveals the answer to test the user's understanding.
